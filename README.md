This file contains the codes used for the IDA early warning tool project. It contains scripts usable for patient data collected from GGZ Drenthe. These scripts do as follows:
- Turn data into dummies
- Perform statistical tests to discover significant predictive variables
- Perform a Random Forest classifier model
- Evaluate the Random Forest classifier performance

Special thanks to Mette Lindhout for co-writing this Python script.
